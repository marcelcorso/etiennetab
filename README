HOW DOES IT WORK?

The extension loads a simple html, js and css into a new page when you open a new tab
The javascript does an ajax request to https://etiennetab.herokuapp.com/gifs.json
On the server side (hosted for free on heroku) we request twitter for @etiennejcb and a bunch of friends.
We get the ones that have a video and put on a list
We write that list into /tmp/gifs.json for caching future requests. (cache gets busted every 6h)
Back on the javascript client we randomly select a gif from the list returned by the server
Update a <video> tag with it and play it full screen
